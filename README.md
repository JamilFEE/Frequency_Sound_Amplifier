# Frequency_Sound_Amplifier
Amplifier circuit allowing you to use a set of headphones to listen to frequency tones using any wave generator.  
  
You can use the Gerber files to manufacture your own PCB, and use the BOM to purchase all the parts needed to build one.
  
Use a wave generator to hear how different frequency tone sound like, you can use it also to test you hearing and see which frequencies your ears cannot hear.
